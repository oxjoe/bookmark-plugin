##### ChromeBookMarkPlugin
 - ALT + (1-9) will open the corresponding bookmark in the CURRENT tab
 
 - ALT + (1-9) x 2 (hitting the number twice) will open the corresponding bookmark in a NEW tab
 
 - Note: make sure your mouse cursor is unfocused and not highlighting anything, if it doesn't work then chances are it is focused onto something. So press the ESC key to unfocus everything
   
   Per the Chrome Docs (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/commands#event-onCommand)
   Note: All key combinations must include either Ctrl* or Alt. Combinations that involve Ctrl+Alt are not permitted in order to avoid conflicts with the AltGr key. Shift can be used in addition to Alt or Ctrl, but is not required. Modifiers (such as Ctrl)
   can not be used in combination with the Media Keys. Tab key was removed from list of supported keys in Chrome version 33 and above for accessibility reasons.
